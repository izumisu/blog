<h2 id="as-simple-as-possible-phone">As simple as possible: phone</h2>
<p>For a more focus phone using habit, this time I have shrinked the
apps on my phone, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meituan(a food delivery app)</li>
<li>Taobao(an online shopping app)</li>
<li>Jingdong(like Taobao but more focusing on deliver speed)</li>
<li>Alipay(like Paypal)</li>
<li>Amap(like GoogleMap)</li>
<li>DuckDuckGo(browser)</li>
<li>Clash(network proxy)</li>
<li>Some bank apps</li>
</ul>
<p>The apps above, some of them I have revoked the account, and none of
them I will remind on my phone. The services or apps I'm still using
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone call</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Wechat</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Here comes the reason:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The uniapp in Wechat, which is kind of web app, could help me done a
lot, like checking map, buying food and calling taxi. Also, Wechat
itself has the QRcode payment function.</li>
<li>I seldom use outside net on my phone, but mainly on my desktop, so
DuckDuckGo and Clash are not that important.</li>
<li>I have revoked the accounts of online shopping apps(Alipay, Taobao,
etc), because I find a strange thing: the things which are bought from
online shopping, in the past decade, seldom are my truly need. And in
this process, I form a bad consume habit: spending early.</li>

<h2 id="blogflow">Blogflow</h2>
<p>Four years ago, I started to write my blog.</p>
<p>I clearly remember, I bought a server from AliCloud, and clumsily
started to figure how to create a blog and publish it.</p>
<p>After that, I had tried tons of ways just for writing my blog,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wordpress on a server</li>
<li>Baota on a server</li>
<li>Obsidian Publish</li>
<li>Nicola blog generator</li>
<li>Hugo blog generator</li>
<li>Notion free web blog</li>
<li>Siyuan community one-click publish</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, none of them fits my need. I think a blog should be like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Simple. No comment function, even no picture, just words.</li>
<li>Centralized. The tools that I use to write blog could be used to do
other jobs, such as writing code or something else.</li>
<li>Edit-friendly. The editor must be one of the tools I'm familiar
with.</li>
<li>Easy-operate. Could work with git, and easy to upload my cloud
virtual host.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scrolling-addiction">Scrolling addiction</h2>
<p>I have just formed a new habit: put my phone into a box, and start my
needy finishing jobs.</p>
<p>Why? Because I find myself distracted when my phone along my side,
often I choose to work half an hour or less and scroll my phone for near
one hour or more. These make me confuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I become so addicted to phone, even I'm not willing to do
so?</li>
<li>All are the electronic devices, why I only get addicted on phone,
rather than laptop or desktop?</li>
<li>Although I know to me, the best solution is TITB(Throw It into the
Box). Is there any other methods?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping these questions in mind, I start to read some website, and
here are some explanation.</p>
<p>When phone lay along with us, we will feel FOMO(fear of missing out),
this is a psychological fact. And due to this, we often pick up our
phone to see whether we have missed something or not.</p>
<p>At the aspect of our body, when we are scrolling our phone, brain
will get a hit of dopamine, keeping us repeat this action.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is, the design of phone and social app, whatever
they are, will put the line below to be their first goal:</p>
<p>Keep you addicted, keep you stick on it.</p>
<p>The phone is perhaps, the easiest device that could be used in any
scenery. Whether come to toilet, or bed, or waiting red light, or
anything, it just so easy to pick up, and then, make the "pick-up" habit
firmly enough.</p>
<p>So, how to break it?</p>
<p>To me, I have no choice. Because I have to do the github project and
find a job. If keep picking up phone, I will definitely lose any chance
of finding jobs. So I just throw it into the box.</p>
<p>After some checks on web, I find some advice, listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Know the motivation of get rid of the addicted.</li>
<li>Make your phone less attracted.(for me i use before launcher).</li>
<li>Mute whatever you could mute.</li>
<li>Put it away when in door.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the advice that I think is useful, you could pick up one or
two and just start it.</p>
