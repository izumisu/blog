<h2 id="clean-my-phone">Clean my phone</h2>
<p>For a more focus phone using habit, this time I have shrinked the
apps on my phone, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meituan(a food delivery app)</li>
<li>Taobao(an online shopping app)</li>
<li>Jingdong(like Taobao but more focusing on deliver speed)</li>
<li>Alipay(like Paypal)</li>
<li>Amap(like GoogleMap)</li>
<li>DuckDuckGo(browser)</li>
<li>Clash(network proxy)</li>
<li>Some bank apps</li>
</ul>
<p>The apps above, some of them I have revoked the account, and none of
them I will remind on my phone. The services or apps I'm still using
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone call</li>
<li>Outlook</li>
<li>Wechat</li>
<li>Bing</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Here comes the reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The uniapp in wechat, which is kind of web app, could help me done a
lot, like checking map, buying food and calling taxi. Also, wechat
itself has the QRcode payment function.</li>
<li>I seldom use outside net on my phone, but mainly on my desktop, so
DuckDuckGo and Clash are not that important, Bing is enough.</li>
<li>I have revoked the accounts of online shopping apps(Alipay, Taobao,
etc), because I find a strange thing: the things which are bought from
online shopping, in the past decade, seldom are my truly need. And in
this process, I formed a bad habit: spending early.</li>

<h2 id="blogflow">Blogflow</h2>
<p>Four years ago, I started to write my blog.</p>
<p>I clearly remember, I bought a server from AliCloud, and clumsily
started to figure how to create a blog and publish it.</p>
<p>After that, I had tried tons of ways just for writing my blog,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wordpress on server</li>
<li>Baota on server</li>
<li>Obsidian Publish</li>
<li>Nicola</li>
<li>Hugo</li>
<li>Notion free web blog</li>
<li>Siyuan community publish</li>
<li>Vimwiki+Server</li>
<li>Element.io</li>
<li>Mastodon</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, none of them fits my need. I think a blog should be like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Simple. No comment function, even no picture, just words.</li>
<li>Centralized. The tools that I use to write blog could be used to do
other jobs, such as writing code or something else.</li>
<li>Editor friendly. The editor must be one of the tools I'm familiar
with.</li>
<li>Easy to use. Could work with git, and easy to upload my cloud
virtual host.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the answer is: Vim+Pandoc+Server.</p>
<p>I write the blog on <em>vim</em>, and use <em>pandoc</em> to finish
markdown2html, then upload to server, of course I also push it to my git
repo. The last three things are done by <em>bash</em> script.</p>

<h2 id="scrolling-addiction">Scrolling addiction</h2>
<p>I have just formed a new habit: put my phone into a box, and start my
needy finishing jobs.</p>
<p>Why? Because I find myself distracted when my phone along my side,
often I choose to work half an hour or less and scroll my phone for near
one hour or more. These make me confuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I become so addicted to phone, even I'm not willing to do
so?</li>
<li>All are the electronic devices, why I only get addicted on phone,
rather than laptop or desktop?</li>
<li>Although I know to me, the best solution is TITB(Throw It into the
Box). Is there any other methods?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping these questions in mind, I start to read some website, and
here are some explanation.</p>
<p>When phone lay along with us, we will feel FOMO(fear of missing out),
this is a psychological fact. And due to this, we often pick up our
phone to see whether we have missed something or not.</p>
<p>At the aspect of our body, when we are scrolling our phone, brain
will get a hit of dopamine, keeping us repeat this action.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is, the design of phone and social app, whatever
they are, will put the line below to be their first goal:</p>
<p>Keep you addicted, keep you stick on it.</p>
<p>The phone is perhaps, the easiest device that could be used in any
scenery. Whether come to toilet, or bed, or waiting red light, or
anything, it just so easy to pick up, and then, make the "pick-up" habit
firmly enough.</p>
<p>So, how to break it?</p>
<p>To me, I have no choice. Because I have to do the github project and
find a job. If keep picking up phone, I will definitely lose any chance
of finding jobs. So I just throw it into the box.</p>
<p>After some checks on web, I find some advice, listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Know the motivation of get rid of the addicted.</li>
<li>Make your phone less attracted.(for me i use before launcher).</li>
<li>Mute whatever you could mute.</li>
<li>Put it away when in door.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the advice that I think is useful, you could pick up one or
two and just start it.</p>

<h2 id="seven-months-in-day1team">Seven months in "Day1team"</h2>
<p>This blog I want to write for a long time, but hard to find a quiet
place to write it.</p>
<p>I spent 9k(about $1200) CNY to join a so-called "hacker team" in
Feburary. At that time I was finding jobs, while lost in anxious, I just
want to do something about security, and this team leader promised that
"you could dig several bugs if you spend time to learn hard".</p>
<p>After getting into the team, I started to learn web bug hunting,
until Augest, I had found two bugs on Ali. At the mean time, I went to
the offline activity which was raised by that team leader, twice.</p>
<p>Directly jump to the conclusion: <strong>the team leader is a
cheater, the whole team just a bunch of script kiddens.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before joining the team, the leader will tell you, learn
tech&amp;earn money, but he won’t say, the payback to white hats was
reducing, every day, because of the economy.</li>
<li>The big bounty requires long-time practice, there are people more
than 300 in this team, but the ones that could earn more than 9k are
less than fifty.</li>
<li>The leader just want your money, of course he would say: oh, I work
hard to find these bounty projects for you guys, if you can’t earn,
shame on your laziness! But he also know that, it’s impossible for all
of the teammate to do these bounty projects.</li>
<li>Noisy wechat groups, after joining in the team, I have entered
almost ten small groups! Either for bug hunting program or chatting. The
people there are noisy, flighty and impetuous. In my eyes, they are just
a bunch of idiot.</li>
<li>Script kidden. The techniques they use to hunt the bugs are just
scripting, without coding. Yes, they use the methods ten years ago.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as I discovered that I had been fooled, I just quit. After
this, I just lost any confidence of any courses or things like that in
China, as I say, they just want to make more money and don’t care what
you think.</p>
<p>The most funny thing is the slogan of the team: <strong>It’s always
day1</strong>.</p>
<p>It could be changed to: <strong>It’s always money</strong>.</p>
