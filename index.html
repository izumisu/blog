<h2 id="blogflow">Blogflow</h2>
<p>Four years ago, I started to write my blog.</p>
<p>I clearly remember, I bought a server from AliCloud, and clumsily
started to figure how to create a blog and publish it.</p>
<p>After that, I had tried tons of ways just for writing my blog,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wordpress on server</li>
<li>Baota on server</li>
<li>Obsidian Publish</li>
<li>Nicola</li>
<li>Hugo</li>
<li>Notion free web blog</li>
<li>Siyuan community publish</li>
<li>Vimwiki+Server</li>
<li>Element.io</li>
<li>Mastodon</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, none of them fits my need. I think a blog should be like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Simple. No comment function, even no picture, just words.</li>
<li>Centralized. The tools that I use to write blog could be used to do
other jobs, such as writing code or something else.</li>
<li>Editor friendly. The editor must be one of the tools I'm familiar
with.</li>
<li>Easy to use. Could work with git, and easy to upload my cloud
virtual host.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the answer is: Vim+Pandoc+Server.</p>
<p>I write the blog on <em>vim</em>, and use <em>pandoc</em> to finish
markdown2html, then upload to server, of course I also push it to my git
repo. The last three things are done by <em>bash</em> script.</p>

<h2 id="scrolling-addiction">Scrolling addiction</h2>
<p>I have just formed a new habit: put my phone into a box, and start my
needy finishing jobs.</p>
<p>Why? Because I find myself distracted when my phone along my side,
often I choose to work half an hour or less and scroll my phone for near
one hour or more. These make me confuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I become so addicted to phone, even I'm not willing to do
so?</li>
<li>All are the electronic devices, why I only get addicted on phone,
rather than laptop or desktop?</li>
<li>Although I know to me, the best solution is TITB(Throw It into the
Box). Is there any other methods?</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping these questions in mind, I start to read some website, and
here are some explanation.</p>
<p>When phone lay along with us, we will feel FOMO(fear of missing out),
this is a psychological fact. And due to this, we often pick up our
phone to see whether we have missed something or not.</p>
<p>At the aspect of our body, when we are scrolling our phone, brain
will get a hit of dopamine, keeping us repeat this action.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is, the design of phone and social app, whatever
they are, will put the line below to be their first goal:</p>
<p>Keep you addicted, keep you stick on it.</p>
<p>The phone is perhaps, the easiest device that could be used in any
scenery. Whether come to toilet, or bed, or waiting red light, or
anything, it just so easy to pick up, and then, make the "pick-up" habit
firmly enough.</p>
<p>So, how to break it?</p>
<p>Here are some methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Know the motivation of get rid of the addicted.</li>
<li>Make your phone less attracted.(for me i use before launcher).</li>
<li>Mute whatever you could mute.</li>
<li>Put it away when in door.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the advice that I think is useful, you could pick up one or
two and just start it.</p>

<h2 id="seven-months-in-day1team">Seven months in "Day1team"</h2>
<p>This blog I want to write for a long time, but hard to find a quiet
place to write it.</p>
<p>I spent 9000 yuan(about $1200) to join a hacker team so-called
"Day1team" in Feburary. At that time I was finding jobs, while lost in
anxious, I just wanted to do something about security, and this team
leader promised that "you could dig several bugs if you spend time to
learn it".</p>
<p>After joining into the team, I started to learn web bug hunting.
Until Augest, I had found two bugs on ASRC. At the mean time, I went to
the offline activity which was raised by that team leader, twice. These
are the things I have done in that team.</p>
<p>Directly jump to the conclusion: <strong>the team leader is a
cheater, the whole team is a bunch of script kiddens.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before joining the team, the leader will tell you, learn
tech&amp;earn money, but he won't say, at least before you pay the bill,
that the bughunting is time wasting and meaningless, the bounty of the
SRC is miserable. A lot of teammates have already give up doing this
stuff.</li>
<li>The learning atmosphere is ****</li>
<li>The leader just want your money, of course he would say: oh, I work
hard to find these bounty projects for you guys, if you can't earn,
shame on your laziness! But he also know that, it's impossible for all
of the teammate to do these bounty projects, and the learning resources
are <strong>not</strong> equally acquired. If you have time, you could
have offline meeting with him. If not, just good luck.</li>
<li>Noisy Wechat Groups. After joining in the team, I have entered
almost ten small groups! Either for bug hunting program or tech
chatting. The people there are noisy, flighty and impetuous. Neither
chatting about women nor complaining about jobs. In my eye, they are
just a bunch of idiots.</li>
<li>Lazy, Stupid Script Kidden. The techniques they use to hunt the bugs
are just scripting, without coding. Yes, they use the methods ten years
ago. Some of them always dream to let other help them do anything, or
expect other could answer all their questions for free. I haven't met
this kind of man before! Even in Discord!</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as I discovered that I had been fooled, I just quit. At this
point, I lose any confidence of any courses or things like that in
Chinar. As I say, they just want to make more money and don't care what
you feel.</p>
<p>The most funny thing is the slogan of the team: <strong>It's always
day1</strong>.</p>
<p>It could be changed to: <strong>It's always money</strong>.</p>

<p>Phone is Phone</p>
<p>Recently I have read an <a
href="https://www.jianshu.com/p/b3d54e14a49b">article</a>, and have the
same feeling with its author. PS If you are English reader, you could
use google translate, or it's ok if don't know what it means.</p>
<p>The main idea of the article is: The author expressed his heart-tried
of social apps usage these years, and finally gave up using
<em>Wechat</em>(instant message app in China).</p>
<p>And I, agree with him.</p>
<p>As Gen Z in China, before high school we use <em>QQ</em>(another
instant app), during high school and college we use
<em>Dingtalk</em>(collaborate app), Wechat and QQ.</p>
<p>For me, these year the social apps I have used more than three above,
they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kehua(an AI-base online 1v1 soul mate app)</li>
<li>Telegram</li>
<li>Hellotalk</li>
<li>Tandem</li>
<li>Gorkor(a random mail-like app, focusing on slow communication)</li>
<li>Qingtenzhilian(a college meet&amp;dating app, focusing on strictly
selection)</li>
<li>Element</li>
<li>All kinds of IRC clients and more</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasons I use these app, either feeling lonely and want to chat
with girls, or just wanna improve my English.</p>
<p>Few years later, I just feel more boring and anxious, and wanna
quit(p.s. I have already quit when I'm writing this line).</p>
<p>You probably have heard this: <strong>Human is social
animal</strong>. But I want to say: Human is offline-social animal, at
least I am.</p>
<p>I could have 20 girls in my wechat contact, could chat with
foreigners all over the world, and could type anything I want to chat
with others, so what? I'm still sitting alone, facing my phone/pc, in a
small rented room, nearly having no friend I could hang out with.</p>
<p>And most important thing is, for me, no matter what kinds of app, the
end of the chatting is <strong>nothing/nobody to chat</strong>. Look
back the history of these apps, I find almost all the messages are
useless, meaningless, thoughtless. Besides, everyone has his/her own
life, both have no interest to chat with a man/woman who isn't really
important to him/her.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs released first <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)">iPhone</a>
on 2007. 17 years later, I'm quit, and go back to phone, message and
email.</p>
<p>It could be a game box, could be a music player, could be a social
center, but I wanna say:</p>
<p>“Phone is phone.”</p>
