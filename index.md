## Some Useful Extensions(for me)

These are four essencial: Dark Reader, Vimium, DuckDuckGo Privacy and I don't care about cookie.

One for dark color, one for swift browsing, and last one for NOT TRACKING

Others like Clipping, Save Video As are also useful, but I don't really use them much.

## Use a new learning method

Yesterday I started to follow my new learning method: **Ask the question, and solve it**.

When I have a question about one specific code/concept, I just take it down to paper, then find way to solve it. If I come across with another, I just repeat the action before.

Below is a part of my scratch on paper:

```
           ----------- @Target    
           |                      
           |                      
           |                      
                                  
@RestController ------ @interface 
                                  
           |                      
           |                      
           |                      
           ----------- @Retention 
                                  
```

Maybe, this is the problem-oriented way.
