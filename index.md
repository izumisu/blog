## Clean my phone
---
For a more focus phone using habit, this time I have shrinked the apps on my phone, they are:

- Meituan(a food delivery app)
- Taobao(an online shopping app)
- Jingdong(like Taobao but more focusing on deliver speed)
- Alipay(like Paypal)
- Amap(like GoogleMap)
- DuckDuckGo(browser)
- Clash(network proxy)
- Some bank apps

The apps above, some of them I have revoked the account, and none of them I will remind on my phone. The services or apps I\'m still using are:

- Phone call
- Outlook
- Wechat
- Bing

Why? Here comes the reasons:

1. The uniapp in wechat, which is kind of web app, could help me done a lot, like checking map, buying food and calling taxi. Also, wechat itself has the QRcode payment function.
2. I seldom use outside net on my phone, but mainly on my desktop, so DuckDuckGo and Clash are not that important, Bing is enough.
3. I have revoked the accounts of online shopping apps(Alipay, Taobao, etc), because I find a strange thing: the things which are bought from online shopping, in the past decade, seldom are my truly need. And in this process, I form a bad consume habit: spending early.

## Blogflow
---
Four years ago, I started to write my blog.

I clearly remember, I bought a server from AliCloud, and clumsily started to figure how to create a blog and publish it.

After that, I had tried tons of ways just for writing my blog, including:

- Wordpress on server
- Baota on server
- Obsidian Publish
- Nicola
- Hugo
- Notion free web blog
- Siyuan community publish
- Vimwiki+Server
- Element.io
- Mastodon

Sadly, none of them fits my need. I think a blog should be like this:

1. Simple. No comment function, even no picture, just words.
2. Centralized. The tools that I use to write blog could be used to do other jobs, such as writing code or something else.
3. Editor friendly. The editor must be one of the tools I\'m familiar with.
4. Easy to use. Could work with git, and easy to upload my cloud virtual host.

Now, the answer is: Vim+Pandoc+Server.

I write the blog on *vim*, and use *pandoc* to finish markdown2html, then upload to server, of course I also push it to my git repo. The last three things are done by *bash* script.

## Scrolling addiction
---
I have just formed a new habit: put my phone into a box, and start my needy finishing jobs.

Why? Because I find myself distracted when my phone along my side, often I choose to work half an hour or less and scroll my phone for near one hour or more. These make me confuse:

- Why I become so addicted to phone, even I\'m not willing to do so?
- All are the electronic devices, why I only get addicted on phone, rather than laptop or desktop?
- Although I know to me, the best solution is TITB(Throw It into the Box). Is there any other methods?

Keeping these questions in mind, I start to read some website, and here are some explanation.

When phone lay along with us, we will feel FOMO(fear of missing out), this is a psychological fact. And due to this, we often pick up our phone to see whether we have missed something or not.

At the aspect of our body, when we are scrolling our phone, brain will get a hit of dopamine, keeping us repeat this action.

And the worst thing is, the design of phone and social app, whatever they are, will put the line below to be their first goal:

Keep you addicted, keep you stick on it.

The phone is perhaps, the easiest device that could be used in any scenery. Whether come to toilet, or bed, or waiting red light, or anything, it just so easy to pick up, and then, make the \"pick-up\" habit firmly enough.

So, how to break it?

To me, I have no choice. Because I have to do the github project and find a job. If keep picking up phone, I will definitely lose any chance of finding jobs. So I just throw it into the box.

After some checks on web, I find some advice, listed below:

1. Know the motivation of get rid of the addicted.
2. Make your phone less attracted.(for me i use before launcher).
3. Mute whatever you could mute.
4. Put it away when in door.

These are the advice that I think is useful, you could pick up one or two and just start it.
