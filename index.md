## Tarsnap: The last backup service

A long short: Tarsnap suits me well.

I have been tried a tons of way to backup my small but important files, for years.

### QQ/Wechat/USB sticks

Yes, using instant apps for saving the files, or just take them as sync service \- may be a habit for lots of Chinese. The reason is simple: we often use these apps to chat and collaborate in school or work, so why not use them? And, actually, seldom Chinese cares about cyber privacy, I mean, most of them are the old generation and not tech nerd.

But here comes the problems:

- First, the available size is small, 100M for wechat and 2G for qq;
- Second, when you send your important file to these apps, without the debate of privary, the problem is, you have coupled with these apps. Once they get uninstalled, or something wrong with you account, all data gone.

Also, I once used USB stick to backup my data, the problem is, slow, and expensive for a reliable stick.

### Google Drive/Apple Drive/Baidunetdisk/Dropbox/and more

I have tried tons of "Drive", before I met tarsnap. They all have the problems: expensive, not friendly to Linux user. The only important file for me are family photo and some codes, less than 2G. But the fee monthly I have to pay is:

- $2.68/month, Baidunetdisk
- $0.99/month, iCloud
- $1.99/month, Google Drive
\...

Finally, I choose to use Tarsnap. To me is $3.00/month, but it's clean, no **ads**, no **gui**, fantastic.
