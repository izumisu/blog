## Tarsnap: The last backup service

Backup target: code/config file/photo(~1.9G)

- [ ] $3.43/month, Baidunetdisk(Ads app)
- [ ] $0.99/month, iCloud(I\'m not iOS user)  
- [ ] free, 15GB, Google One(speed to slow in China)
- [ ] $4.12/month or $27.33/year, Nutstore(expensive, price/performance low)
- [x] $3.00/month, Tarsnap(cli friendly, simplicity, \*nix friendly, cheap)


## Some Useful Extensions(for me)

These are four essencial: Dark Reader, Vimium, DuckDuckGo Privacy and I don\'t care about cookie.

One for dark color, one for swift browsing, and last one for NOT TRACKING

Others like Clipping, Save Video As are also useful, but I don\'t really use them much.


## Use a new learning method

Yesterday I started to follow my new learning method: **Ask the question, and solve it**.

When I have a question about one specific code/concept, I just take it down to paper, then find way to solve it. If I come across with another, I just repeat the action before.

Below is a part of my scratch on paper:

```
           ----------- @Target    
           |                      
           |                      
           |                      
                                  
@RestController ------ @interface 
                                  
           |                      
           |                      
           |                      
           ----------- @Retention 
                                  
```

Maybe, this is the problem-oriented way.


## Rush reading of Daemonic Dispatches

Today I spend half day rushing over the blog of **Colin Percival**, these are some blogs I find to be interesting:

- Blog tech details
- Garbage collection is evil
- Security Mindset is trained by mathenmatics
- Tarsnap: No heartbleed here

To be honest, a lot of his blogs are about BSD, and I just skipping them, because of boring(maybe one day I will find them interesting).

## Move to Warp!

Just embrace the new tech and use warp!

Goodbye kitty~
