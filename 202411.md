## Blogflow

Four years ago, I started to write my blog.

I clearly remember, I bought a server from AliCloud, and clumsily started to figure how to create a blog and publish it.

After that, I had tried tons of ways just for writing my blog, including:

- Wordpress on server
- Baota on server
- Obsidian Publish
- Nicola
- Hugo
- Notion free blog
- Siyuan community publish
- Vimwiki+Server
- Element.io
- Mastodon

Sadly, none of them fits my need. I think a blog should be like this:

1. Simple. No comment function, even no picture, just words.
2. Centralized. The tools that I use to write blog could be used to do other jobs, such as writing code or something else.
3. Editor friendly. The editor must be one of the tools I\'m familiar with.
4. Easy to use. Could work with git, and easy to upload my cloud virtual host.

Now, the answer is: Vim+Pandoc+Server.

I write the blog on *vim*, and use *pandoc* to finish markdown2html, then upload to server, of course I also push it to my git repo. The last three things are done by *bash* script.

## Phone is Phone

Recently I have read an [article](https://www.jianshu.com/p/b3d54e14a49b).

Its main idea is: The author expressed his heart-tried of social apps usage these years, and finally gave up using *Wechat* and other social app.

QQ, Wechat, X, Kehua, Telegram, Hellotalk, Tandem, and more\...

Few years later, I just feel more and more anxious, and now I quit.

For me, the end of these apps is **nothing/nobody to chat**. Either meaningless or boring, I rather read the [lwn](lwn.net).

Steve Jobs released first [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)) on 2007. 17 years later, I\'m quit, and go back to phone, message and email.

It could be a game box, could be a music player, could be a social center, but I wanna say:

\"Phone is phone.\"

## Arch Linux Installation Record

Just in case I have to reinstall my Arch on other pc, I write the steps down below.

### Partition

My fdisk habit is below:

| Partition | Size            | Format     |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| [SWAP]    | 4GB             | mkswap     |
| /         | 50% of the disk | ext4       |
| /home     | 25% of the disk | btrfs/ext4 |
| /boot     | 1GB             | fat32      |

After partition, mount them, following these steps: `/root` -> `swap` -> `/boot` -> `/home`.

Then select the mirror, for me, the *ustc* one is the best:
```
Server = https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
```

Now may pacstrap:
```
pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware

genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### Install needy package

Use `arch-chroot` into the system.

After entering the system, quickly download these package I often use:

Use *pacman* to download the clash, move it from `/bin` to `/usr/local/bin`.

Then follow the instruction [here](https://blog.iswiftai.com/posts/clash-linux/).

And remember enable some services like: lightdm, clash, networkmanager.

### Reboot
Unmount all and reboot.

Do something to make desktop simplier:

1. Right click and open budgie-desktop-config
2. Change the `Bottom` panel to `Top`
3. Change `Size` to 28
4. Change `Spacing` to 4
5. Change `Transparency` to Always

## Stop using browser bookmark

Once, I had tried number of ways to make my bookmark bar become more usable, including deleting some useless marks, using a bookmark manager or just port them to my blog, in case one day I would use them.

From now on, I STOP USING THE BOOKMARK.

Why? It is useless.

Bookmark = Spam. Bookmark is like spam, but this kind of spam is the people send it and use by themselves. The man who saves bookmark just like a squirrel who saves nuts in winter.

History > Bookmark. \^ \+ `keyword` help me a lot.

Maybe, I guess, one day, `bookmark` the function could be deleted?
